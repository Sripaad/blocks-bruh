An essential part of a node is to share and sync the blockchain with other nodes. 
The following rules are used to keep the network in sync.

    When a node generates a new block, it broadcasts it to the network
    When a node connects to a new peer it querys for the latest block
    When a node encounters a block that has an index larger than the current known block, it either adds the block the its current chain 
    or querys for the full blockchain.
